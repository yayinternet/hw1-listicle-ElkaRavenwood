					There once was a lady.
				  	<br>Smart. Intelligent. Brilliant. A Genius.
					<br>These were the words that haunted her for years on end.
				  	<br>Everyone expected her to be smart, to score perfectly, to test well, and for many years, she did. And there was a pride in that. But she became tired, oh so tired and she didn't score perfectly, she didn't test well, she wasn't the genius they labeled her as, and it terrified her.
					<br>And the Girl Who Thought All Beautiful recognized that and thought: she is the Lady Who Was More Than Smart.
				 	<br>She was surrounded by expectations she could not meet, and she was so scared of what people would say. For so long, she was defined as smart - what would she be without it? So the Lady Who Was Only Smart became the Lady Who Was Smartly Sarcastic. She created a prickly shell that pushed everyone away from her, preferring the absence of company to the stifling expectations. And it worked. She was happy. "Happy"
				  	<br>But the Girl Who Thought All Beautiful still thought of her as the Lady Who Was More Than Smart. Because over the sarcastic layer, was a beautiful girl who hid in baggy clothes. And under that prickly exterior, there was the heart of a good friend. Someone who would push you to do what's right and would always look after you. There was a person who was a romantic, and would put aside her heart for the ones she cared for and there weren't that many people who saw it. And most importantly, the Lady Who Was Smartly Sarcastic, the Lady Who Was More Than Smart didn't see it.
				  	<br>And it hurt the Girl Who Thought All Beautiful that the Lady Who Was More Than Smart couldn't see it.
				  	<br>But eventually, many years after they met. the Lady Who Was Smartly Sarcastic realized she was truly the Lady Who Was More Than Smart, and that was perhaps the most beautiful thing.

				  	There once was a boy.
					<br>He was a sarcastic child, and sometimes went out of his way to make things difficult for other people. And that was all people saw. He could be condescending, rude, and not altogether pleasant. And that was all people saw.
					<br>They didn't see that he could be the kindest person they'd ever met. They didn't see that he was an ear to people who thought they had none, and that his making things difficult? It was to draw an exasperated laugh out of those around him. They didn't see that he could be caring, and to those that needed it, was a quiet support, steady and lasting.
					<br>And the Girl Who Thought All Was Beautiful saw this.
					<br>She tried to tell people this, but who would believe her? The others saw what they wanted to see. Someone to dislike and criticize and they felt better about themselves. Sometimes it was merited, but never to the degree they mocked the Boy Who None Thought Nice.
					<br>She didn't know the story behind his mask, or the reason why he tried so hard to hide. But she didn't care. She thought him beautiful, extended a hand of friendship and he accepted.
					<br>But other people couldn't see it. They saw someone fall for a standoffish prick. They assigned a romantic notion to something  purely, beautifully platonic. And she feared that another friendship would have ended.
					<br>The Boy Who None Thought Nice was stronger though. He didn't care what other people said, and when he did, he locked it behind his mask like everything else, and smiled. Of course, the smile often predated something childish (difficult), silly (rude) thing he did, so no one was the wiser, but he didn't care, and the Girl Who Thought All Was Beautiful found beauty there too.

					<p class = "title">3. The Queen</p>
				  	<p class = "date">November 11, 2018</p>
			 	</div>
				<p class = "text">
					There once was a queen.
					<br>She had more than most would ever see, and that is all the people knew of her. "She is greedy", they said. "She feasts in her castle while we starve. She is protected from everything, wanting for nothing. How can she know what the real life is like?" And she said nothing.
					<br>There once was a queen.
					<br>The people hated her. She left her castle once a week for a walk with her guards. She talked to no one, was seen by everyone, and they said, "She's too proud, she would never deign to speak with us commoners." Some of her guards heard, and the man was executed. And she said nothing. 
					<br>There once was a queen.
					<br>When some of the Royal Guard were found mysteriously dead, she spoke for the first time; she made a speech. She said that wrongdoers would always be caught, and that no one was exempt from their crimes. So whoever hurt the loyal guards come forth, puniahment will be dispensed. No one stepped forth. And when the remaining guards knocked on doors to find the culprit, the people were in a fury. "How dare she condemn us, for what one of hers did first. How is this fair?" they cried. And she said nothing.
					<br>Afterwards, the people went to the broken houses in trepidation. They opened the doors and asked the inhabitants, "Are you okay? Did they hurt you? Take anything?" They dug through the rubble and found baskets of food and of medicine. Of items they had needed for winter and for the elderly, of items they dreamed of, but hadn't had a hope of getting.
					<br>And the Girl Who Thought All Was Beautiful smiled. For the people had realized that the queen didn't lie - all wrondgoers would always be caught and pay for their crimes. After all, they thought, weren't the dead in the Royal Guard the rapists protected by noble blood, and the bloodthirsty ones who cried for our deaths. Wasn't it so that the last time (5 years ago) someone tried to talk to the queen, he was executed, and only after that did she stop talking freely. Didn't the queen come every week to see what we needed, but said nothing so we would be safe. The lights had turned on and the people finally saw.
					<br>There once was a queen.
					<br>She saw more than most would ever see, and none of it was hers. She was trapped in a glass castle which looked so beautiful, but was so terrible on the inside. The walls suffocated her and it felt like the world was ending and she was carrying the sky. Her people were suffering and what did it matter that they did not think them their queen, they were HERS and hurting and she could do nothing and ---.
					<br>There once was a queen.
					<br>And she had more than most would would ever see. But this is not what drew people to her. It was her fire, her hope, her spirit and protectiveness. It was the knowledge that if ever you were considered hers, you would be safe, because she would not let you go, forbid you from being lost. After all, royals are greedy, and the queen is no different.
